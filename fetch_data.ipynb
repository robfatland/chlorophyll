    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One such expansion is considering other sources of data. We have for example \n",
    "a snapshot of the global ocean called GLODAP. After inspecting that on a global\n",
    "scale we turn to a comparison of vertical profiles through the water column, \n",
    "specifically salinity and temperature. We want to compare GLODAP profiles as somewhat \n",
    "*static* snapshots with ongoing active profile measurements from ARGO drifters.\n",

    "the water column: Both deep profilers that ascend from the sea floor and shallow profilers \n",
    "that rest on platforms at 200 meters depth and ascend to within a few meters of the surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin the RCA work focused on the shallow profiler as this is where the highest\n",

    "\n",
    "`yodapy` is a contraction of **Y**our **O**cean **DA**ta **PY**thon library. It was written \n",
    "by Don Setiawan to facilitate working with **OOI** data in general (not just profiler data).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before `yodapy` was written the process of finding and ordering data for OOI \n",
    "was a bit *involved*.  `yodapy` was developed to make this process more \n",
    "*programmable* and to provide search capability\n",
    "without having to know precise terms like \n",
    "`RS01SBPS-SF01A-3D-SPKIRA101-streamed-spkir_data_record`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses `yodapy` to search for, identify, order and download data, all in Python. \n",
    "A future extension of `yodapy` will make this process even simpler, referencing data that\n",
    "are already in place on the public cloud. Rather than order and download data you simply\n",
    "start working with it using the `XArray` idiom. \n",
    "\n",
    "<BR>\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Takeaway 1: This notebook reviews `yodapy` specific to Regional Cabled Array (RCA) \n",
    "data but the pattern of use is relevant to data from other OOI segments.**\n",
    "\n",
    "<BR>\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Takeaway 2: A heads-up on authenticating: The OOI system requires you to *authenticate* your identity.\n",
    "You do this by registering your email at their website. This is unrestricted, there is\n",
    "no cost and it only takes a couple of minutes. `yodapy` helps you manage your resulting\n",
    "credentials so once this is set up you are authenticated automatically.**\n",
