# C5 projects

5 things to do that all begin with C; all intended to address Wendi's "last ten yards" characterization: How do I find
the data? How do I trust it? What do I do with it?


## chlorophyll


Ocean surface (MODIS) to sea floor (shallow / deep profilers) to other resources (ARGO)


## coincidence


A profiler (SCIP) at rest on a platform should be registering the same temperatures as the platform temperature sensor...



## Canon: profiling profiler profiles


What is the data canon? By which we mean: What are the expected ranges of the sensors as a function of 
depth and season? What is the variance? Do VISIONS discrete datasets agree with this in the 'nearest time' sense?
This project is essentially an expanded analysis of the patterns in the data. 


## Cetus megapterii


Getting whales from phones to phones


# coup de ballon


kicking the tires of the interactive oceans website. One of the deliverables here is to 
produce a data chart and then reproduce it precisely in a notebook.
