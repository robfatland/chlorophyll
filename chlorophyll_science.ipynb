    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of **chlorophyll** makes sense in the context web of interrelated ideas we call *ecology*.\n",
    "Ecology is the study of the relationships between living things and their physical environment. \n",
    "In this notebook we will start to explore marine ecology using chlorophyll as an organizing principle. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "To free-associate for a moment: Life on earth, including life in the ocean, is built on carbon atoms.\n",
    "Carbon-based molecules associated with life are called *organic* while simpler carbon-based molecules\n",
    "like carbon dioxide are *inorganic*. Each molecular compound in this carbon-based picture has its \n",
    "own characteristic energy storage capacity.\n",
    "  \n",
    "    \n",
    "We are consequently interested in carbon reservoirs in the \n",
    "ocean as both basis for and constituent of the ocean biome. The ecology of the ocean\n",
    "can be seen as a spectrum with inorganic carbon dissolved in ocean water at \n",
    "one end and a set of carbon-based apex predators at the other.\n",
    "So let's start at both ends of this spectrum and work our way around a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inorganic carbon: Simplest carbon compounds \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The ocean-atmosphere interface tends to encourage dissolving of atmospheric carbon dioxide in the ocean. However \n",
    "once a carbon dioxide molecule enters the ocean the rules change. Atmospheric CO2 has a half-life of 60 years\n",
    "whereas dissolved CO2 in the ocean has a half-life of minutes. What happens to it? It enters the world of carbonate\n",
    "chemistry which involves exchange with a set of related molecules, all mediated at fairly low activation energies. \n",
    "\n",
    "--Here outline the carbonate chemistry zoo--\n",

    "Sunlight not the direct energy source for this creature\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Let's take as one of several apex predators the hammerhead shark. Specifically the ***Great Hammerhead Shark*** \n",
    "([Sphyrna mokarran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_hammerhead))\n",
    "which specializes in eating other sharks and rays. How many stages of predation are below this apex? \n",
    "Suppose a great hammerhead swimming off Madagascar eats a bluespotted stingray \n",
    "([Neotrygon kuhlii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuhl%27s_maskray)) who in turn has been dining on \n",
    "butterfly chiton ([Cryptoconchus porosus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptoconchus_porosus))\n",
    "that feed on benthic diatoms; that is a type of algae that attaches to the sea bed in shallow waters. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Diatoms convert sunlight to chemical energy by photosynthesis. This happens in organelles using a pigment\n",
    "called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis generates carbohydrates that store energy. The molecular basis of this\n",
    "process is carbon dioxide and other carbonate molecules plus water. Molecular oxygen is a by-product of\n",
    "this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So as a matter of four steps through the food web we arrive at an energy source -- carbohydrates -- \n",
    "created by diatoms from sunlight. As a creater of energy stored in carboyhydrates the diatom is classfied\n",
    "as a *producer*. As a beneficiary of this stored energy the chiton is a *consumer*; as are the stingray\n",
    "and the Great Hammerhead. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A key idea in this quick sketch is the following: Carbonate molecules dissolved in ocean water are\n",
    "considered inorganic and are not usable as an energy supply. Carbohydrate molecules are built from\n",
    "these carbonate molecules and they *are* usable as an energy supply (by both producers like the \n",
    "diatom and by consumers like the Great Hammerhead.) So the conversion from inorganic to organic\n",
    "molecules via sunlight is they key energy transformation at the base of the food web. Carbon is\n",
    "ubiquitous in the ocean; but it is always undergoing change in molecular form from lower to \n",
    "higher stored energy and back again. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests two questions that are the basis of this discussion. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. How is the machinery of primary production organized and maintained in perpetuity? \n",
    "2. What are the important reservoirs, transport mechanisms and transport rates of the ocean carbon cycle?  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dissolved Organic Matter (DOM)\n",
    "\n",
    "This section starts off on the machinery by supposing it is messy. Bits and pieces everywhere, left over in the soup.  \n",
    "It outlines that intermediate carbon compounds -- still organic; but not functional within \n",
    "a living organism -- are the second carbon reservoir we want to identify. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Microbial ecology \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This section picks up the DOM story to introduce metabolites and energy consumption as dependent on iron,\n",
    "nitrates, some phosphorous; temperature mediated; and so on. So there are more things in...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Physical Ocean\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This section arrives at the question of microbial ecology in relation to the second way that the \n",
    "sun is involved, driving transport of the physical ocean together with coriolis and so on. Atmospheric \n",
    "heat exchange. Subduction introduces longer time scales. Heating at mid-ocean ridges. This ought to\n",
    "dip a pennant to the GLODAP elevation slider."
