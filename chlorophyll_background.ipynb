    "    * Two of the nine daily profiles run at local midnight and noon\n",
    "        * These feature spectrophotometer measurements during *ascent* and nitrate measurements on *descent*.\n",
    "    * These two special profiles take upwards of two hours to complete. (The other seven require less time.)\n",
    "    * In between profiles: The profiler or Science Pod (SCIP) is at rest on a platform at a depth of 200 meters\n",
