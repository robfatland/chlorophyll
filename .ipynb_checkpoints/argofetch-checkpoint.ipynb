    "[ARGO drifters](https://argo.ucsd.edu/faq/#look) are carefully designed scientific instruments.\n",
    "Physically they are cylinders about 20 cm in diameter and 1.3 m in length. They use a buoyancy control \n",
    "bladder to regulate their depth and they measure temperature, salinity, pressure and additional\n",
    "biogeochemical observables. ARGO drifters typically float in the deep ocean\n",
    "at a depth of 1000 meters. After residing at that depth for ten days they descend to 2000 m and \n",
    "then ascend through the water column to the surface where they report back via satellite link. \n",
    "Then they return to 1000 meters and the process repeats for the life of the drifter, typically \n",
