    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One such expansion is considering other sources of data. We have for example \n",
    "a snapshot of the global ocean called GLODAP. After inspecting that on a global\n",
    "scale we turn to a comparison of vertical profiles through the water column, \n",

    "the water column: Both deep profilers that ascend from the sea floor and shallow profilers \n",
    "that rest on platforms at 200 meters depth and ascend to within a few meters of the surface.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "`yodapy` is a contraction of **Y**our **O**cean **DA**ta **PY**thon library. It was written \n",
    "by Don Setiawan to facilitate working with **OOI** data in general (not just profiler data).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before `yodapy` was written the process of finding and ordering data for OOI \n",
    "was a bit *involved*.  `yodapy` was developed to make this process more \n",
    "*programmable* and to provide search capability\n",
    "without having to know precise terms like \n",
    "`RS01SBPS-SF01A-3D-SPKIRA101-streamed-spkir_data_record`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses `yodapy` to search for, identify, order and download data, all in Python. \n",
    "A future extension of `yodapy` will make this process even simpler, referencing data that\n",
    "are already in place on the public cloud. Rather than order and download data you simply\n",
    "start working with it using the `XArray` idiom. \n",
    "\n",
    "<BR>\n",

    "> **Takeaway 1: This notebook reviews `yodapy` specific to Regional Cabled Array (RCA) \n",
    "data but the pattern of use is relevant to data from other OOI segments.**\n",

    "You do this by registering your email at their website. This is unrestricted, there is\n",

    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook resides in \n",
    "a sub-directory of the User's home directory `~`. It is bundled \n",
    "as an open source \n",
    "[github repository](https://github.com/robfatland/chlorophyll).\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data must reside *elsewhere* in the \n",
    "working environment, i.e. not within the repo directory.\n",
    "I use `~/data/` with sub-directories to organize data content outside\n",
    "of the `~/chlorophyll` directory. \n",
    "Each data source (MODIS, GLODAP, ARGO, RCA, ...) gets a dedicated sub-directory in `~/data`.\n",

    "`xarray` has a wildcard multi-file open utility: `xr.open_mfdataset(\"Identifier*.nc\")`.\n",

    "The RCA data are ordered using a less convenient dimension, namely\n",
    "observation number `obs`. This is just an ordinal integer 1, 2, 3, ...\n",

    "\n",
    "## Obtain Regional Cabled Array data using `yodapy`\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted above the `yodapy` library enables Python-based access to OOI data. In this case we will focus\n",
    "on the Regional Cabled Array (RCA) and particularly on the shallow profiler found at the site \n",
    "**Oregon Slope Base**. This site is at the base of the continental shelf in about 3000 meters of water.\n",
    "The shallow profiler rises and falls nine times per day through the upper 200 meters of the water column.\n",

    "### OOI data access back-story\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To order data from **OOI** requires you to pre-register (free, using your email address). This provides you \n",
    "credentials when placing a data order. Orders typically take a few minutes for the OOI\n",
    "servers to assemble; after which you receive an email with a download link. You download the data to local storage\n",
    "and read files into memory and proceed from there, a very labor-intensive process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How `yodapy` helps\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[`yodapy`](http://github.com/cormorack/yodapy) helps you automate OOI data access at each step. \n",
    "It sets up a credentials directory within your home directory;\n",
    "and in so doing helps you avoid accidentally pushing your credentials to `github` where they would be public. `yodapy` \n",
    "allows you to create a Python object called an `OOI()` that includes methods for finding sensor data of interest; \n",
    "for ordering time-bounded datasets for those sensors; for downloading this data; and for attaching it to a data \n",
    "structure (an `xarray Dataset`) for further analysis. It is at this point when you have your data present as a \n",
    "`Dataset` that `yodapy` has completed its job. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The next cell installs `yodapy`. Run this each time you start up this notebook server unless your installation\n",
    "of the `yodapy` library persists. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting OOI credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To get data from OOI you first create a User account as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visit the [OOI website](https://ooinet.oceanobservatories.org/#)\n",
    "- On the login menu (upper right) select **Register**\n",
    "- Fill out the New User Registration Form\n",
    "- Once you have your login credentials: Log in\n",
    "- The 'Login' menu should be replaced with your User name at the upper right: Also a dropdown menu\n",
    "  - Use this menu to select User Profile\n",
    "- At the bottom of your User Profile page you should find **API Username** and **API Token**\n",
    "  - These two strings comprise your authentication \n",
    "  - Keep them somewhere safe\n",
    "  - Notice that the **Refresh API Token** button permits you to regenerate them whenever you like\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Use your OOI API Token with `yodapy` as described further down to automate your authentication process.\n",
    "If this works as intended you can safely use OOI and not have to worry about cutting and pasting these\n",
    "token strings every time you want to get data access.\n",
