    "\n",
    "\n",
    "XArray precedes Dask; and is built upon pandas and NumPy. The following steps \n",
    "require a few hours to go through; plus additional time spent internalizing\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask is a task scheduler that coordinates and speeds up larger computations. Some of what Dask\n",
    "is good at happens \"behind the scenes\" in XAarray; so in principle there is nothing to learn\n",
    "per se. However this is a bit vague so let's look at it from a more open-ended inquiry: What\n",

    "Unfortunately some questions are inaudible so it can be difficult to follow in places. \n",
    "Also there is very little motivation in the exposition. One key idea that goes by \n",
    "rather quickly is \"in memory / not in memory\". This refers to whether a given calculation\n",
    "fits in the computer's RAM. If not it may be a good candidate for Dask; which has a \n",
    "formalism for breaking tasks into components and executing them in an ordered fashion\n",

    "[examples of Xarray in action](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/examples.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- XArray is built on two data container forms or *types*: The `Dataset` and the `DataArray`.\n",
    "  - A Dataset is comprised of one or more DataArrays\n",
    "  - I abbreviate Datasets as `ds` and DataArrays as `da`\n",
    "    - Useful: Start a variable name with <source_>, as in `glodap_`\n",
    "    - Useful: Append a variable name with <_sensor>, as in `glodap_ds_temp` \n",
    "  - Create a Dataset out of thin air... or by compounding a DataArray\n",
    "  - Create a DataArray out of thin air... or by extraction from a Dataset \n",
    "  - The Xarray formalism expands from `pandas` dataframes\n",
    "    - As noted this is taught in the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)\n",
    "  - An XArray `Dataset` is comprised of four subsets with standard names\n",
    "    - Dimensions, Coordinates, Data Variables and Attributes\n",
    "    - A precise understanding of all four of these is quite helpful\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "The parts of an Xarray Dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Dimensions`\n",
    "2. `Coordinates`\n",
    "3. `Data variables` \n",
    "4. `Attributes` is for my purposes a *dictionary* of metadata. These can be created and deleted. \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Above I mentioned \"running out of RAM\" as a problem for large calculations that suggests using Dask. \n",
    "There is another aspect to this work as well that also touches on scale. It is common at meetings\n",
    "to see very focused investigations. These might work from a *small* collection of data of say \n",
    "*two* parameters at a *precise* location on the earth for a *narrow* range of time. \n",
    "One might for example analyze and publish an excellent paper on Pacific Chorus Frog calls observed \n",
    "in spring of 2007 at Lake Tapps, Washington. It may well have required hours of painstaking work\n",
    "preparing the data; but there it is at last. And then... it might be interesting to generalize the \n",
    "results in a larger study: Across larger geographical area and time extent. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What we would like to avoid is -- say three months later -- doing the same \n",
    "painstaking preparation of a slightly different dataset \n",
    "beset with its own idiosyncracies. One imagines writing code just once \n",
    "and for all for use in all special cases to build the larger story out. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That's why we're here: Generalization and abstraction. Abstraction of data, of code, \n",
    "of compute infrastructure: All the components of data science where we really do not have the time\n",
    "for bespoke effort endlessly repeated. Our bet is that by going through this learning \n",
    "process we will find a net gain in time and effort in data analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning for a moment to one of our two practical examples: The Ice Problem was \n",
    "developed in a few-degrees-square region of Southeast Alaska (a single UTM zone)\n",
    "with a lot of moving ice. The method however applies to the Himalayas, to the \n",
    "Patagonian Icefield, to British Columbia and to many other glacier-covered regions. \n",
    "The Ice Problem computation could and should be run on a global scale over the \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing they try to teach us about Dask is that it has a method -- really a *decorator* -- that operates on a computational task\n",
    "in two phases. The first phase is where dask draws a graph of the problem; and the second phase is where dask grabs execution threads \n",
    "made available by the host computer and uses each of them to resolve the nodes of this graph which are of course smaller compute tasks\n",
    "that must be run in some implicit order. This implies there must be something very clever about dask that allows it to construct this\n",
    "directed acyclic *task solver* graph... but I suspect that the cleverness resides with us as coders. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dask `delayed`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by using functions that have built in one-second delays that simulate some computing time. The do trivial things. \n",
    "The functions are themselves not touched by the dask formalism; but the composition of these functions into a compute task\n",
    "brings in the dask function `delayed`.\n",
    "\n",

    "I learn that `dask.delayed` is a Python *decorator* so here is what that means:\n",

    "existing object without modifying its structure. Decorators are usually called before the \n",
    "definition of a function you want to decorate. [...] **Functions in Python [...] support operations \n",
    "such as being passed as an argument, returned from a function, modified, and assigned \n",
